# Pratik Sontakke - AI Backend & Cloud Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Pratik Sontakke, an **AI Engineer** with a deep foundation in backend and cloud systems. I specialize in bridging the gap between innovative AI concepts and the secure, scalable, production-grade infrastructure required to run them.

My focus is on building end-to-end AI applications, from architecting advanced **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems and multi-step agents to deploying and monitoring them in a production environment. I thrive on solving the complex backend challenges that make AI not just smart, but also reliable and fast.

### ðŸ’» Core Technologies & Skills:

- **AI & Machine Learning**: RAG, AI Agents, LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, LLMs, Fine-Tuning (LoRA, QLoRA)
- **Backend & Databases**: Python, Java, FastAPI, Spring Boot, SQL, Vector DBs (PGVector, Chroma, Pinecone)
- **Cloud & MLOps**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, MLflow
